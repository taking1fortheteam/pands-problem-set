SO this is not the 1st or the 2nd but the 13th line in my bleeding test script! I really hatethis programming language as ther ara so many ways to do the same thing! It is a real annoyance!
But then again it is an intereetingly powerful language!]
I hope I can get good at using it.
The join function will concatenate a list of strings. But since a in your case is int, you create a list of strings of elements in a using the map function. The map function will apply a function across all elements in a list. In this case, I am using str function to convert the integer into string.
